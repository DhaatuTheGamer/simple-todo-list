# Simple To-Do List App

## Description

This is a straightforward and easy-to-use To-Do List application created using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript. It helps you keep track of your tasks directly in your web browser. All tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even if you close the browser window or refresh the page.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks using the input field.
* **Mark as Complete:** Click the circle next to a task to mark it as done (it will be crossed out).
* **Edit Tasks:** Double-click on the text of an active task to edit its details, including text, due date, and priority. Press Enter or click away to save.
* **Due Dates:** Assign a due date to your tasks, which will be displayed alongside the task.
* **Priority Levels:** Set a priority (Low, Medium, High) for each task, visually indicated by a colored border.
* **Star Tasks:** Click the star icon to mark important tasks.
* **Delete Tasks:** Click the trash can icon to remove a task (a confirmation will appear).
* **Filter Tasks:** Use the sidebar to view All, Starred, Active, or Completed tasks.
* **Task Searching:** Use the search bar to quickly find tasks by matching text content.
* **Automatic Sorting:** Sort tasks by due date (oldest or newest first), priority (high-low or low-high), or name (A-Z or Z-A).
* **Drag & Drop Reordering:** When in 'Default' sort order, click and drag active tasks to change their order manually.
* **Clear Completed:** A button appears to easily remove all completed tasks at once.
* **Light/Dark Theme:** Toggle between light and dark modes using the sun/moon icon.
