# Simple To-Do List App

## Description

This is a straightforward and easy-to-use To-Do List application created using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript. It helps you keep track of your tasks directly in your web browser. All tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even if you close the browser window or refresh the page.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks using the input field.
* **Mark as Complete:** Click the circle next to a task to mark it as done (it will be crossed out).
* **Edit Tasks:** Double-click on the text of an active task to edit it. Press Enter or click away to save.
* **Star Tasks:** Click the star icon to mark important tasks.
* **Delete Tasks:** Click the trash can icon to remove a task (a confirmation will appear).
* **Filter Tasks:** Use the sidebar to view All, Starred, Active, or Completed tasks.
* **Clear Completed:** A button appears to easily remove all completed tasks at once.
* **Drag & Drop Reordering:** Click and drag active tasks to change their order in the list.
* **Light/Dark Theme:** Toggle between light and dark modes using the sun/moon icon.
* **Local Storage:** Your tasks are automatically saved in your browser.

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Structures the content of the web page.

## Future Ideas (Optional)

* Add due dates or priority levels to tasks.
